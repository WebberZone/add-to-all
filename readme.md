A powerful plugin that will allow you to add custom code or CSS to your header, footer, sidebar, content or feed.

## Description

[Add to All](http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/add-to-all/) is a simple, yet powerful plugin that will allow you to add HTML, JavaScript or CSS to your header, footer, content or feed.

It comes with out of the box support for Google Analytics, Statcounter, Kontera and Tynt with other third party services in the pipeline. If you have any script that isn't supported by Add to All currently, you can just add the code to the Header or Footer sections.

With this plugin installed, you do not need to edit your theme files every time you switch themes.

Add to All comes with a pre-installed copyright notice added to your feed and you can also add in a link to your post or any other HTML or text that you might want.
