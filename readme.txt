== Description ==

<a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/add-to-all/">Add to All</a> is a powerful plugin that will allow you to add custom code or CSS to your header, footer, content or feed.

Add to All comes with out of the box support for Google Analytics, Statcounter, Kontera, with other third party services in the pipeline.

With this plugin installed, you do not need to edit your theme files every time you switch themes. You can also add custom CSS styles to your header as well as any HTML code to the header or footer of the theme.

The plugin gives you the power to add content to your feed in addition to adding a copyright notice. This is especially useful if you have any website scraping your feeds.

== Wishlist ==

Below are a few features that I plan on implementing in future versions of the plugin. However, there is no fixed time-frame for this and largely depends on how much time I can contribute to development.

* Limited Facebook support to add your fan page in the sidebar
* Limited support for Google Adsense code
* Support for PHP code
* Sidebar widgets
* Support for Wibiya
* Support for Infolinks
* Support for Text Link Ads

If you would like a feature to be added, or if you already have the code for the feature, you can let me know by <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/add-to-all?forum_id=10">posting in this forum</a>.
