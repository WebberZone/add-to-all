A powerful plugin that will allow you to add custom code or CSS to your header, footer, sidebar, content or feed.

== Description ==

<a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/add-to-all/">Add to All</a> is a simple, yet powerful plugin that will allow you to add HTML, JavaScript or CSS to your header, footer, content or feed.

It comes with out of the box support for Google Analytics, Statcounter, Kontera and Tynt with other third party services in the pipeline. If you have any script that isn't supported by Add to All currently, you can just add the code to the Header or Footer sections.

With this plugin installed, you do not need to edit your theme files every time you switch themes.

Add to All comes with a pre-installed copyright notice added to your feed and you can also add in a link to your post or any other HTML or text that you might want.

Several customization options are available via the Settings page in WordPress Admin. You can access this via <strong>Settings &raquo; Add to All</strong>

The plugin supports CSS, HTML and JavaScript code in the header and footer. PHP support is likely to be added in future versions


= Wishlist =

Below are a few features that I plan on implementing in future versions of the plugin. However, there is no fixed time-frame for this and largely depends on how much time I can contribute to development.

* Limited Facebook support to add your fan page in the sidebar
* Support for PHP code
* Sidebar widgets
* Support for Infolinks

If you would like a feature to be added, or if you already have the code for the feature, you can let me know by <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/add-to-all">posting in this forum</a>.
